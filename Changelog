TODO:
* better visualized view(may be step number)
* 3pin net
* rip-up reroute
* add heuristic to traceback
* add electrode constraint detection

Problem:
* how to determine the net-order?
seems to be a crucial problem:(see DAC05 subproblem 6)
order: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3, then after 0,1, 
When traceback, 2 should move down at the 1st step i.e. HOW to avoid bounding
box overlapping when traceback

DONE:
* droplet should stay in a position until routing end
* Visualize the route result
* how to ensure the traceback path valid?

Problem(solved):
* how to ensure the least bending? (See DAC05 subproblem 3, net 2.)
Currently the program go right first, maybe solve this should solve net-order
problem?
According to Liliang:
use another value to denote bending, also it can be added into weight
also, for other bounding box, can be added as weight

* problem: how to decide the first step of the backtrack, when there are two
direction to choose?

* unknown dead loop
seems that it is caused by more than one net has the same destination
