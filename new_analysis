3,5	:loop, netorder deadlock
6	:slow, can not find result
9	:good case, big problem but solved 

updated:
3,5,6 solved!
--------
IMPORTANT:
case 11 has problem : fixed
case 16 problem: electrode interference : fixed
case 20 problem: extra activated electrode : fixed( should waste disposal droplet's location after it reached there)

case 30 problem: unknown, can not find path
now solved,too large search space... need some time


case 45: net 3 can not be routed, maybe be blocked by net 1,2
solved: added a heuristic, when some net is causing too much conflict, ripup it


case 47: 3-pin net, need implementation
