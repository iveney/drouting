SUMMARY of questions that need to handle:
** When doing rip-up and re-route, should also remove the voltage assignment
  1.the same procedure like in electro constraint, however remove edge
  but not add edge
see PROBLEM below

  *2.clear all colors and reconstruct the graph (try_do_coloring)
   this may be correct

  3.keep track of what node/edge has been added by a net,
    and use this information to delete them -> but also need to know
    the later routed net's intrduced conflict caused by this net.
    by using this method, we may also have the information that
    which net introduced most conflicts
PROBLEM: if do it like this, there is problem, e.g.
two droplets use row=5, and both have an edge between row=6
but if one be ripped up, the edge will be removed,
however, another droplet still require this conflict
SOLUTION: keep edge count!!

** how to handle the electro constraint of 3-pin net
(now not handle at all, just think as no constraint at all)

** 3-pin(multipin) net testing(merging),check how utexas handle
  my idea:the late net should use the route after merged

** stalling problem of coloring(add dotted line(different edge))

** waste disposal checking(check what?) -- DONE

NOTE: when a droplet 
1.stalling
2.reaches destination and stop there, 
no need to add voltage assignment on that time step( i.e. coloring )

IMPORTANT:
how to treat the waste disposal?
seems that they should be queued in, but after reaches at t+1, can disappear at t+1

IMPORTANT NOTE: according to utexas input, they specify the waste disposal point in the case

now I added those points into the test case file

IMPORTANT:
for multipin net/same dest net
if they can merge earlier, than it can potentially decreases conflict(since droplet number
is decreased)
But we do not know if use this method would increase conflict rate or note before they merge!

how to do?
my idea: build MRST, calculate merge point, then route to there, and do post processing 
to finalize the route

problem:
if we do it like now.i.e. hierachically route net,
  for each net
      for each subnet
but not
  decompose net into a series subnet
  for each subnets

there is sth. we might miss
1. can not specify the routing order of multi-pin's subnet -- is it important?
   the order would be pin-0,pin-1...(althought only 3 pin here)

* important problem:
  now found out that can not simply fill up the destination point till timing constraint,
  when a droplet reach there(e.g. T=20, droplet 1 reach dest at t=13,then for t=14 to 20, 
  I just simply fill the route with same dest) but other droplet may pass by later,
  and it might blocks the way!

-> proposed solution: add fluidic Check in EVERY time step till timing constraint reached.
   NOTE: even for the step STALLING, this check needs.

* 3-pin net
* rip-up reroute --> 
  when there is more than 1 net blocking it, how do we know which net to choose to rip-up?
  is there any good heuristic? or just rip-up all net?
  is it possible that two net block each other?

* implement Evan's Idea 4 : 2-coloring
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3-24
* implement Evan's Idea 1 -- DONE
* write class about routing result -- DONE
* How to terminate a net-routing if it take too long a time?

Evan's Idea:
1. delete electro/fluidic penalty, when encounter such a case, just do not put into heap
2. stalling problem. whether to add stall at each step or add it when no grid to go?
3. how to avoid propagating the same cell(is it matter when GridPoint has a same pt,but different time? or same time)
4. think about how to use 2-coloring
5. is bending really matter?
6. how to make use of electro detection? (for some routed nets, there exist some feasible assignment of voltage,
   and may be more than one configuration, how to avoid totally re-do the 2-coloring?

TODO:
* note that a cell that was propagated is not nessessary to be propagated again
  however, if the cell is reached before at time A, and reached at another time B
  1. A<=B , no need to propagate
  2. A>B  , can propagate

* implement a priority queue for use!
  since STL manual says that priority_queue can not be raondomly accessed
  have to implement a heap by own, or wrap make_heap sort_heap into a custom class

* how to denote a node's parent?
  is it reasonable to use Reference Type in C++ in the class?
  or use map + macro to find its parent?
  one idea is tha map is a static member in the class, 
  which stores all the mapping
  and use a method to return current object's parent
  BUT:  map has to declare the type, but the definition of this class is not ended!

* what is the definition of parent?
  Position + time already enough?
    3
    |
  1-2

  2-3
  |
  1

 for both case, 3 is two bend with time = 3, position the same
 but its parent is different!
 HENCE: it's neccessary to let different obj have own parent
