problem:
if we do it like now.i.e. hierachically route net,
  for each net
      for each subnet
but not
  decompose net into a series subnet
  for each subnets

there is sth. we might miss
1. can not specify the routing order of multi-pin's subnet -- is it important?
   the order would be pin-0,pin-1...(althought only 3 pin here)

* important problem:
  now found out that can not simply fill up the destination point till timing constraint,
  when a droplet reach there(e.g. T=20, droplet 1 reach dest at t=13,then for t=14 to 20, 
  I just simply fill the route with same dest) but other droplet may pass by later,
  and it might blocks the way!

-> proposed solution: add fluidic Check in EVERY time step till timing constraint reached.
   NOTE: even for the step STALLING, this check needs.

* 3-pin net
* rip-up reroute --> 
  when there is more than 1 net blocking it, how do we know which net to choose to rip-up?
  is there any good heuristic? or just rip-up all net?
  is it possible that two net block each other?

* implement Evan's Idea 4 : 2-coloring
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3-24
* implement Evan's Idea 1 -- DONE
* write class about routing result -- DONE
* How to terminate a net-routing if it take too long a time?

Evan's Idea:
1. delete electro/fluidic constraint, when encounter such a case, just do not put into heap
2. stalling problem. whether to add stall at each step or add it when no grid to go?
3. how to avoid propagating the same cell(is it matter when GridPoint has a same pt,but different time? or same time)
4. think about how to use 2-coloring
5. is bending really matter?
6. how to make use of electro detection? (for some routed nets, there exist some feasible assignment of voltage,
   and may be more than one configuration, how to avoid totally re-do the 2-coloring?

TODO:
* note that a cell that was propagated is not nessessary to be propagated again
  however, if the cell is reached before at time A, and reached at another time B
  1. A<=B , no need to propagate
  2. A>B  , can propagate

* implement a priority queue for use!
  since STL manual says that priority_queue can not be raondomly accessed
  have to implement a heap by own, or wrap make_heap sort_heap into a custom class

* how to denote a node's parent?
  is it reasonable to use Reference Type in C++ in the class?
  or use map + macro to find its parent?
  one idea is tha map is a static member in the class, 
  which stores all the mapping
  and use a method to return current object's parent
  BUT:  map has to declare the type, but the definition of this class is not ended!

* what is the definition of parent?
  Position + time already enough?
    3
    |
  1-2

  2-3
  |
  1

 for both case, 3 is two bend with time = 3, position the same
 but its parent is different!
 HENCE: it's neccessary to let different obj have own parent
