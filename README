TODO:
* implement a priority queue for use!
  since STL manual says that priority_queue can not be raondomly accessed
  have to implement a heap by own, or wrap make_heap sort_heap into a custom class

* how to denote a node's parent?
  is it reasonable to use Reference Type in C++ in the class?
  or use map + macro to find its parent?
  one idea is tha map is a static member in the class, 
  which stores all the mapping
  and use a method to return current object's parent
  BUT:  map has to declare the type, but the definition of this class is not ended!

* what is the definition of parent?
  Position + time already enough?
    3
    |
  1-2

  2-3
  |
  1

 for both case, 3 is two bend with time = 3, position the same
 but its parent is different!
 HENCE: it's neccessary to let different obj have own parent

* note that a cell that was propagated is not nessessary to be propagated again
