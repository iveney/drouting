DATE06_3 prob 6: net 0 two subnet merged before reach the sink
should think about some way

DAC05_2 prob 53:
now net 3 has silly movements, how to avoid
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. fix the deadlock
2. check why adding lenght failed
3. checkou why sometimes deadlock while sometimes not
4. DAC05_2 53, DAC05 30
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. minimize cell
2. loop problem
3. deadlock problem
4. fix the reach-sink-point bug(should add electrode constraint there)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. DAC05_2 prob 53
check how to solve the loop movement

2. try to incorporate len as a field in the status
(but it may not be accurate, because length can not reflect cell used,
and we are not optimizing length)
